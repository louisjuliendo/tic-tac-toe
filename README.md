# Tic Tac Toe - Build with React

## Getting Started

- This is a tutorial from [React Official Site](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).
- How to play:
  - The game is played on a grid that's 3 X 3.
  - There are 2 players:
    1<sup>st</sup> player 'X' and the 2<sup>nd</sup> 'O', will take turns to mark the board's square.
  - The first player to get 3 marks of rows (up, down, across, or diagonally) wins the match.
  - If there are no 3 consecutive marks in a row and the 9 squares are full, game ends with a tie.
  - Players are allowed to backtrack to go back to any specific point of time or restart the match.

## To Do

- [x] Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
- [x] <del>Bold</del> Highlight the currently selected item in the move list.
- [x] Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
- [ ] Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
- [ ] When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
- [ ] When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.
